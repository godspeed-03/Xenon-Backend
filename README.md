# How to contribute setup server locally

Server is running on a public domain : `url/api/v1`

This should be a pretty simple setup, as the app doesn't have many external service dependencies.

## Forking and Cloning the project

Development is on development branch. 

to clone a single branch development 

```
git clone --branch developemnt https://github.com/Event-DTL/EventDTL-Backend.git

```

To clone main production branch 
```
git clone https://github.com/Event-DTL/EventDTL-Backend.git

```


I suggest reading the [Github's guide on forking projects.](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/)

<br />

## Visual Studio Code Setup

I also suggest using Visual Studio Code as your IDE, with the following extensions installed:

- ESLint
- Prettier - Code formatter

<br />

## Installing Node.js

The app depend on Node.js, a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 Engine.

You can download it here: https://nodejs.org/en/download/. The project currently supports version 18.17+

<br />

## Installing dependencies

Open the terminal on the root directory (I use the VSCode terminal) and do the following steps:

Go into the app directory

```
cd EventDTL-Backend
```

Install dependencies using npm

```
npm i
```

This should add a _package-lock.json_ file and a _node_modules_ directory inside the _app_ directory.

<br />

## Environment Variables

Copy all the variables to configure the server

```
touch .env 
```
or create new .env file

**copy all envs to .env file**

<br />
<br />

**Finally! You're done with the setup and installation, now you can start the server**

## Running the development app

If you have done every step above, you're ready to start developing.

Make sure you're in the app directory, if you're not, run this command:

```
cd EventDTL-Backend
```

And now you can start the app by running the command:

```
npm run dev
```

And there it is! You can now access the app at:

http://localhost:8080
